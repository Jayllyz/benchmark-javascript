# Benchmark Javascript

This repository contains benchmarks for various Javascript operations and constructs.
I want to use this repository as a reference for (mostly) myself and others to understand the performance implications of different Javascript operations and constructs.

If you are interested about performance in Javascript, here are some other resources that you might find interesting:

- [yagiz blog](https://www.yagiz.co/) Yagiz Nizipli, creator of the performance team at Node.js.
- [lemire blog](https://lemire.me/blog/tag/javascript/) Daniel Lemire another awesome developer focused on performance.
- [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/) This book is a must-read for anyone interested in web performance.
- [Twitter communities](https://x.com/i/communities/1808971770751504458) Twitter (X) communities about Node.js performance.

## How to run the benchmarks

```bash
git clone [this-repo]
cd [this-repo]

pnpm install
pnpm run bench
```
